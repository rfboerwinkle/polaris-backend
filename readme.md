# Polaris

Polaris is (will be) an online Chinese Checkers platform!

You can find the frontend here:

<https://github.com/bdsriver/ChineseCheckers>

and the engine here:

# Installation

`requirements.txt` has a list of required debian packages (which map pretty much 1-to-1 to python packages).

Happy Checkering!
